# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repository. `README.md` and
`docs/plan.md` are the design record; this file is the entry point.

## The memory layer

@MEMORY.md

⚠️ **That import is the point of the file, not decoration.** `MEMORY.md` and
`memory/` are the distilled layer — one hard-won fact per file, with why it
matters — and they live **in the repository** because a machine's own Claude
memory directory is workspace-scoped and machine-local: this repo opened on
another machine, or outside the workspace the notes were written in, arrived with
none of them.

It is a **distillation, not the record.** This file and the repository's other
documents stay the authority; where a note disagrees with the file that owns the
subject, the repository wins and the note is what to fix. `MEMORY.md` carries the
rules the notes are written under — one line per note in the index, one fact per
file, say why rather than only what, and delete a wrong note rather than adding a
second one beside it.
